# Khubaib_Khawar_Assignment_ROUND1

## Please change the name of folder "trial_ass_r1(REMOVE_THIS_TEXT)" to its original name, i.e. "trial_ass_r1", after downloading it.

## I deployed on Heroku using the same name, and GitHub was considering it another repository, thats why I had to change the original name to push the code to the GitHub Repository.
